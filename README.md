# InvadedSoup v1.0 by Yochran
A replica of InvadedLand's soup core.

# Note
This plugin is FAR from complete. Once it is done (and after I get MegaPvP's permission), I will release this plugin to the public. Until then, it remains open source and incomplete, until of course I finish it.

# Features

### Commands:
  - Soup: Get a list of the subcommands for the soup core.
  - SetSoupSpawn: Set the spawnpoint for the server.
  - Help: Get the help for the server.
  - More coming soon...
  
### Listeners:
  - A Kit selector GUI.
  - A Help item that is binded with the /help command.
  - Login events, that sets the players spawnpoint, clears their inventory, kit, and gives them the spawn items.
  - More coming soon...
  
The original InvadedLands soup server core was created by MegaPVP, this is simply a replica.
